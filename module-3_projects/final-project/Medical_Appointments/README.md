## Overview

The goal of this project is using machine learning to build and train a model to predict if patients show up to medical appointments or not.

The main questions this project answeres are:

    1. Which are the key features that impact patientsâ€™ no show?
    2. How can the no show rate be reduced?
    3. How can the prediction of the now show rate be integrated into daily practice management? 


* What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer?
	* Make sure the question description is human-friendly because you will have non-tech audience to see your final project presentation.
* What is the hypothesis you would like to test in order to answer your question?
	* Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.
* How will you test your hypothesis?	

Project Structure:

	1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
    2. Data Analysis & Visualization
    3. Model Building
    4. Model Evaluation
    
Tech Stack:

	* Python 3.0
    * Pandas
    * Numpy
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * Scikit-Learn

## Data Preparation

### Overview:

* What is your dataset about?
* Where/how did you obtain your dataset?
	* It can be either a public dataset or collected with API/web scraping.
	* Provide a link if possible.
* General description of the dataset such as the size, complexity, data types, etc.

### Data Ingestion

* If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* If you obtain the data via API/web scraping, provide the scripts.

### Data Wrangling and Cleaning

* Your full process of data wrangling and cleaning.
* Document your workflow and thinking process.

### Data Storage

* Dump your data to a MySQL database and/or a `.csv` file.

## Data Analysis

### Overview

Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.

### Data Exploration and Visualization

* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Print charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. Charts make your presentation look good too.
* If you use ML in your final project, also describe your feature selection process.

### Model Training and Evaluation

* Train your ML model, produce results, and evaluate.
* This is an iterative process. Try your best to improve your model performance by:
	* More data cleaning.
	* Try different models and select one that is the simplest yet produce the best result.
	* Try advanced techniques and see if they improve the result.

## Conclusion

* Summarize your data analysis result.
* State your conclusion of your hypothesis testing.
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.
* What are the next steps?
